        Social media has changed the way people get information,
        disseminate information, communicate, and stay in touch with
        others, both online and in the real world. As more and more
        people from different age groups and socioeconomic backgrounds
        begin adopting social media and becoming active users, data is
        being created at a geometric rate. The analysis of all this
        data being generated can be used in a myriad of different
        ways, including nefarious ones. It is possible to analyze the
        digital footprint of social media users in order to accurately
        target enormous swaths of a population with propaganda,
        misinformation, and deception which have been created to cater
        to the specific population's social or political bias.

        As the world becomes more technologically advanced, more and
        more work is being done on computers digitally versus in the
        real world physically. This shift in how work is done is
        creating a situation where huge swaths of people are sitting
        down for longer periods of time than is medically recommended
        for healthy living. For many, this has created the need for
        more exercise and athleticism than what one typically gets in
        a normal day. This occupational atrophy is one of the driving
        forces in the development of technology that monitors and
        generates data of the user's day-to-day physical activity and
        vital signs. All this new data being created is helping make
        improvements in the lives of those with sedentary jobs, while
        also revealing new techniques and applications for already
        existing training or exercise programs. The data is being
        generated at an increasing rate from the growing number of
        users who track their activity with the use of sports
        trackers, smart clothing or athletic wear, and mobile
        phones. The applications of this data are not limited to
        improving the health of office workers and other employees
        whose jobs or lives require low physical activity. The
        datafication of physical fitness and activity is also changing
        the way professional athletes and coaches approach their
        training regiments, as well as having military applications in
        regards to training personnel.

        As the human population swells to staggering numbers that
        historians of yesteryear could not imagine, one very important
        question seems to keep coming up over and over again. How do
        we feed all of these people? Thankfully, humans are
        intelligent beasts and are figuring out ways to farm and
        produce larger amounts of food using methods and techniques
        more sophisticated than ones humanity has relied on in the
        past. The party is just getting started as farming meets the
        era of big data. As more and more data is generated from
        farming, techniques and processes become more sophisticated,
        cleaner, and more efficient.  The kind of data being analyzed
        to improve agricultural endeavours comes in many forms, and
        can be statistical data like amount of food grown using how
        much land, actual data generated from using farm tools and
        other smart farming equipment, or any other kind of
        agricultural activity that can produce datafies actions and
        procedures. However, data science is helping in other ways,
        too, as scientists and engineers are taking advantage of all
        this newly available data and helping create new technology to
        improve food production and increase yields With all this new
        information available, new farming endeavours are being
        undertaken. Farming within closed systems such as urban or
        vertical farming, practicing precision agricultural
        techniques, or even laboratories using genetics data on
        different plant strains to crossbreed the various plant
        strains in order to produce new breeds that can grow in the
        harshest of environments while using minimal resources. As the
        population grows, we are finding that not only is the
        production of food vital, but also that sustainable farming
        techniques are of paramount importance for long term
        agricultural need. Data Science and its applications are most
        definitely changing the way people produce food and the very
        nature of farming itself.
